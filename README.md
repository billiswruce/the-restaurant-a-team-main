# Our Journey Through the Restaurant Reservation System Project

## Introduction

As part of our coursework, we, a group of students, embarked on a journey to create a web page for a conceptual restaurant. Our goal was to not just fulfill a project requirement but to bring a virtual restaurant to life, showcasing its unique offerings and enabling guests to book tables through a reservation system we built from scratch.

## What We Created

Our application unfolds across three main pages:

- **Homepage**: We designed this to warmly welcome visitors, offering them a glimpse into what makes our restaurant special.
- **Booking Page**: This is the heart of our project, where guests can effortlessly make reservations.
- **Contact Page**: We included this to ensure that anyone could easily reach out to us with inquiries or feedback.
- **Menu Page**: A hard coded menu. 

## Behind the Scenes

To accommodate guests, our virtual restaurant boasts 15 tables, each capable of seating six people. We set up two dining sessions each evening to maximize our offering. Implementing this required us to dive deep into React and TypeScript, crafting a system where availability could be checked, and bookings could be made and managed—all through an intuitive interface.

### Technical Insights

- **Frontend Magic**: We used React and TypeScript for their robust capabilities, allowing us to create a dynamic and responsive user experience.
- **Leveraging APIs**: The [School Restaurant API](https://school-restaurant-api.azurewebsites.net) became our ally, enabling real-time data handling for reservations. 

### Challenges We Overcame

- Designing the **reservation search functionality** was a puzzle. It involved intricate logic to check for available times and seamlessly manage user inputs.
- The **booking form** tested our skills in user data handling and validation, ensuring a smooth but challenging experience from start to finish.

## Admin Mode: Our Control Center

We integrated an admin mode for the seamless management of reservations. This enabled restaurant staff to modify, delete, or add reservations as needed, ensuring operational flexibility. You find it on /admin.

## Our Learning Curve

This project was a holistic learning experience, emphasizing not just technical skills but also project management and team collaboration. Here's how we organized our journey:

- **React Router**: Implemented to structure our application effectively.
- **API Integration**: Taught us the importance of backend communication.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensured our application looked great on any device.
- **Code Structure**: We learned the value of clean, well-organized code.
- **Project Management**: Using Trello, we kept track of who did what, ensuring a collaborative effort.

## Getting Started

Our first step was to create a restaurant through the API—a foundational task that set the stage for everything that followed.

## A Collaborative Effort

Our project lives in a Git repository, a testament to our collective effort and individual contributions. Trello was our project management tool, helping us stay aligned and accountable.

We hope you enjoy exploring our restaurant reservation system as much as we enjoyed creating it.
